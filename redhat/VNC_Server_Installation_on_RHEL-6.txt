How to Install and Configure a VNC Server on RedHat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) 6

1. Installation of the software
Ensure you are logged in as 'root'
If you have connectivity to RHN or a Satellite Server :
# yum install tigervnc-server

2. Configure VNC password for the user(s)
Switch user to the user you want to use for VNC :
# su - vncuser1

NOTE: Replace 'vncuser1' with the correct username
Set the VNC password for the user:
$ vncpasswd
$ exit
Repeat for each VNC user as necessary

3. Configure resolution for the user(s)
Edit '/etc/sysconfig/vncservers' with your favorite editor
Append the following lines:
VNCSERVERS="5:vncuser1 6:vncuser2"
VNCSERVERARGS[5]="-geometry 1024x768"
VNCSERVERARGS[6]="-geometry 1024x768"
NOTE: Replace 'vncuser1' and 'vncuser2' with the correct usernames. You can add more users as needed. In addition, you can change the resolution value as needed.

4. Start the VNC server
Start the service :
# service vncserver start
Ensure service is started on reboots :
# chkconfig vncserver on

5. Configure the firewall
# iptables -I INPUT -m state --state NEW -p tcp --destination-port 5901 -j ACCEPT
# iptables -I INPUT -m state --state NEW -p tcp --destination-port 5902 -j ACCEPT
	.  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .
# iptables -I INPUT -m state --state NEW -p tcp --destination-port 5909 -j ACCEPT
NOTE : Each user requires an additional firewall port opened starting at 5901. Because we added two users above, we need to open two ports.
# service iptables save
